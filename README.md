!!!WARNING!!!

I am not responsible for prints that do not turn out as intended or any damages that occur as a result of installation or usage of these buttons.

!!!WARNING!!!

There are a nearly endless number of MX switches floating around out there.  While you may be able to use all sorts of other switches in these, I cannot guarantee that any other switches will work.  It is highly recommended to try a switch or two out to ensure proper operation before buying a ton of them.


!!!WARNING!!!

The v6 boards from the original OSBMX (with built in connector prongs) are no longer supported due to multiple reports of the connectors breaking (very thin PCBs like to snap)

!!!WARNING!!!
